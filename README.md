# Python + SQL E-commerce Data Analysis

This project performs various data analysis tasks using Python and SQL on an e-commerce dataset. It covers a wide range of business metrics and KPIs, from customer behavior analysis to sales performance insights. The code leverages libraries like `pandas`, `MySQL`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` for data processing, visualization, and database connectivity.

## Project Overview

### Key Analyses Performed:
1. **Unique Cities of Customers**  
   Query to list all unique cities where customers are located.

2. **Orders Count in 2017**  
   Calculates the total number of orders placed in the year 2017.

3. **Total Sales by Category**  
   Analysis of the total sales generated per product category.

4. **Percentage of Orders Paid in Installments**  
   Determines the percentage of orders where payment was made in installments.

5. **Customer Distribution by State**  
   Counts the number of customers from each state.

6. **Monthly Orders in 2018**  
   Displays the number of orders placed in each month of 2018.

7. **Average Products per Order (By Customer City)**  
   Finds the average number of products ordered per order, grouped by customer city.

8. **Revenue Contribution by Category**  
   Calculates the percentage contribution of each product category to the total revenue.

9. **Correlation Between Product Price and Purchase Count**  
   Identifies the correlation between the price of a product and the number of times it has been purchased.

10. **Revenue by Seller**  
    Computes the total revenue generated by each seller and ranks them.

11. **Moving Average of Order Value per Customer**  
    Calculates the moving average of the order values for each customer over their order history.

12. **Cumulative Sales by Month**  
    Tracks the cumulative sales per month for each year.

13. **Year-over-Year Growth Rate of Total Sales**  
    Calculates the YoY growth rate of total sales.

14. **Customer Retention Rate**  
    Calculates the retention rate, defined as the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.

15. **Top 3 Customers by Spending (Each Year)**  
    Identifies the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **SQL**: For querying the e-commerce database.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **MySQL Connector**: For database connectivity.

## Visualizations
Several visualizations are generated throughout the analysis:
- Bar plots for customer distribution, total revenue, and top-spending customers.
- Line charts for cumulative sales and moving averages.
- Correlation heatmaps for understanding relationships between variables.
